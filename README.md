## About
Langton's ant is an algorithm that produces a seemingly random pattern to begin with. After some time through the same
pattern repeats over and over again called the highway. Read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant. 

## How to use
Download the project and double-click the index.html. Go grab some coffee while you wait for the highway to happen.
